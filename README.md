## Contents


The [R Project](https://github.com/dmurraystoker/OGC-biomass/blob/main/OGC-biomass.Rproj) provides a local relative directory for all data and R code.


### Data

All processed data are provided in the [data folder](https://github.com/dmurraystoker/OGC-biomass/tree/main/data), with the raw data available in the [raw data folder](https://github.com/dmurraystoker/OGC-biomass/tree/main/data_raw). Metadata are provided [here](https://github.com/dmurraystoker/OGC-biomass/blob/main/metadata.md).


### R Code & Data Analysis Summary Reports

R code and summary reports are provided in the [data analysis folder](https://github.com/dmurraystoker/OGC-biomass/tree/main/data_analysis). Data management and primary analyses were conducted using the [OGC-biomass-primary_analyses.Rmd](data_analysis/OGC-biomass-primary_analyses.Rmd) code, and the associated primary analyses workspace is also provided ([OGC-biomass-primary_analyses-workspace.RData](data_analysis/OGC-biomass-primary_analyses-workspace.RData)). Environmental comparisons were conducted using the [OGC-biomass-environmental_comparisons.Rmd](data_analysis/OGC-biomass-environmental_comparisons.Rmd) code, and the associated environmental comparisons workspace is also provided ([OGC-biomass-environmental_comparisons-workspace.RData](data_analysis/OGC-biomass-environmental_comparisons-workspace.RData))
